st.markdown("""
This report explores how causal inference can be used to optimize business decisions, specifically around discount strategies. Instead of estimating average effects, we dive into **Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE)** to understand **who** should receive a discount.
            
Instead of asking **"What‚Äôs the overall impact of a discount?"**, we ask **"Who should receive a discount?"**

We use **T-learners** to model both potential outcomes:
- `Y(1)`: Units sold **with** a discount  
- `Y(0)`: Units sold **without** a discount

Since only one of these outcomes is observed per customer, we train two models:

- `t‚ÇÄ = f(Y | X, t = 0)`  
- `t‚ÇÅ = f(Y | X, t = 1)`

We then estimate the treatment effect for each customer:


`CATE(X) = t‚ÇÄ(X) - t(X)`

To make this interpretable, we compute the **relative lift**:

`Relative Lift = CATE / Baseline Demand`

This tells us the percentage increase in units sold if a discount is offered.

Customers to the **right** of the red line (0) are positively influenced by a discount ‚Äî they're more likely to purchase more.

Customers to the **left** of the line might actually reduce demand or show no change when offered a discount.

Understanding this distribution helps in **personalizing discount strategies** ‚Äî targeting customers who are most likely to respond positively.
